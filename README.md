## Project Motivation
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. According to the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, the scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. Six factors â€“ economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.

In this research, I will use the world happiness data from 2017 and 2019 to infer:

1. What countries rank the highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors contributing to happiness?
2. What is the degree of influence and correlations of the six factors on the overall score?
3. Which factors correlate more with the Happiness score?

## Files Descriptions
With this project, there are two notebooks regarding the data exploration and modelling, along with a python file with functions used in the analysis.

## Results
When the analysis is concluded, the findings will be published with a link provided [here](https://medium.com/@joanamlmsantos/how-happy-are-you-in-the-world-today-4381c09e2b?sk=31debd56d8138f4defd641b98d421e38).
